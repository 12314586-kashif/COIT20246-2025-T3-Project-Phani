## Reflection on Commits and Tasks
Both students have their own commit frequencies, depending upon the tasks assigned in the project. However, the number of commits that are made are not strictly proportional to the contribution, for example, the Kashif can have more commits due to small updates but Shiva can have less commits due to heavy tasks like risk assessment analysis. Also, there are some technical tasks like using cloud platform’s cost calculators to find out the cost for the virtual machines but comparing it with each other takes more time.

## Weekly Commit Frequency
Our group had made consistent commits throughout all weeks out of all 12 weeks term and everything was committed in a timely manner.

## Reflection on Group Work
While working in the group, I have enjoyed doing the project and to start with this project, we both have defined each other’s role in the project. Kashif told shiva to focus on the NIST framework to determine the security controls that we have to use for the highly sensitive data asset. This helps both of us to avoid overlapping our work. Furthermore, we had also utilized the Truelec’s case study as the single source of truth and ensured everything is done within the scope. This is done by considering the Part A network design to stick to the requirements listed earlier.

Doing so also brought some issues like version control conflict and communication lag with each other. In the version control conflict, we struggled with as both were doing commits but was avoided when we only committed our own projects. Also, for the communication, we dedicated to call each other once a day for keeping each other up to date.

In the future, if any projects similar to these projects will be carried out, the three major techniques will be adhered like atomic commits, scheduled sync meetings and peer code/design review. This will help in analysing all the small functional changes, remain up to date and committing the data properly.
