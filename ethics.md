## Data Privacy and Security Issues
Primarily, for the established business like Truelec, the connections between HQ and branch offices introduces various ethical and social responsibilities for handling the data. Basically, the types of data collected by the Truelec includes customer & client data, employee data and surveillance data. For each type of data collected, it includes confidential information which must not be misused or stolen by cyber -attackers.

Some of the risks and vulnerabilities that can be faced by the Truelec primarily includes unauthorized access and data breaches. In the unauthorized access, there could be weakness in the Wi-Fi connections, or lack of physical security controls at the site results in unauthorized access to the CRM systems or financial records. In the same way, the data breaches are possible when a software attack or the internal people error results in a misconfigured server that handles the customer, client and other data. In order to tackle this, the relevant regulations and implications that applies to the Truelec are explained underneath.

1. The Privacy Act 1988 is required to be complied under which Australian Privacy Principles (APP) are defined for dictating how the Truelec can collect, use and secure the data.
2. The Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) Scheme is also required to be adhered so that if any breach is faced with serious harm to the customers, the organization will be legally required to notify all the affected parties, including the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).
3. Failure to comply with the Australian legislation will result in facing hefty fines which can exceed $50 million or 30% of the adjusted turn over of the company.
